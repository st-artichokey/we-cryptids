# CONTRIBUTING

Anyone is welcome to submit as long as they observe the following guidelines and adhere to the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

## What to Submit

The genre for this project is Urban Fantasy only (no Science Fiction or Horror, although horror elements may be present in the story). When writing your story, consider that you’re writing about real experiences that real people have, not just something fictional characters have to deal with. Do your research and write with compassion.

Stories that feature cryptids as monstrous due to their marginalization are unlikely to be approved.

As an example, consider a story that features a nonbinary cryptid who is a cryptid and nonbinary, rather than one that features a nonbinary person who is a cryptid because they're nonbinary.

Although it is important to acknowledge the pain and suffering experienced by those who are marginalized, this is not the place for grimdark. Your contribution does not need a happily ever after, but components of joy, hope, and empathy are required.

When choosing a cryptid to write about, please be conscientious of the cultural history of the legend in question and respectful of the cultures from which it originates. Because of this, stories written from one’s own cultural experiences are encouraged.

This project welcomes and seeks out submissions from writers of color, writers outside of the gender binary, writers who are differently abled, neurologically atypical writers, LGBTQIA+ writers, and other diverse individuals.

## How to Submit

This repository uses standard git processes, including pull requests. When submitting your story, create a separate branch with the title of the story. This will be the branch for your story and for the discussion around it. Fill out the PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE and feel free to use the labels to describe your story. You will need two approvals to merge your story into main.

Respond to comments/questions on your story in-line, and feel free to mark them as resolved as necessary. The comments on the work itself should be for line edits and other minor questions.

## How to Review

Comment on stories in-line for edits/suggestions/concerns. Use the branch comments space for general comments/suggestions/kudos on the story.

Additionally, remember not everyone comes from the same context as you. Be kind when commenting and assume positive intent. Please abide by the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) when interacting with others' work.

## Copyright

All authors retain the copyright on their stories.

However as this is a public repository, sharing your work here counts as a publication and thus will make your work ineligible for markets that require first world rights.
