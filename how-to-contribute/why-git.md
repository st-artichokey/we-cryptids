# Github Overview

Github is a system that allows users to manage and store things like software and, in this case, writing. I'm using GitHub for this purpose because:


- It is a familiar tool for many users and for those unfamiliar with it, the documentation is user friendly.
- As a version control technology, it enables collaborative work, peer review, and conversation around the work and suggested changes.
- I think it would be fun to try using version control for a collaborative writing project.
