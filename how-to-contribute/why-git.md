# Why Github

## What is Github and why are you using it?

Github is a system that allows users to manage and store code and information such as software and, in this case, writing. I'm using GitHub for this purpose because:

- It is a familiar tool for many users and for those unfamiliar with it, [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) is user friendly.
- As a version control technology, it enables collaborative work, peer review, and conversation around the work and suggested changes.
- I think it would be a good experiment to use version control for a collaborative writing project with a shared theme.
- It seemed like a good idea.

Using a version-controlled system for a writing project not only enables some interesting opportunities for collaboration, but also invites experiments with versioning. The peer review pull request process enables communication with the author not only at the end result, but also during the writing process. Co-writing in the same story can be done using different branches, with the end result of a unified document, or a story with many endings.

The ideas listed here are only the beginning of possibility. I'm excited to see what you come up with and look forward to helping you along the way.

## How do I use GitHub?

If you would like a more detailed overview, Github's documentation is very helpful. This overview assumes you already have a Github account and have set up your credentials. If you have not, start with [Github's quickstart documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) and come back once you've completed part one.

For the purposes of this project, you will need to complete at minimum the following setup tasks in the above guide:

[Create an account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#1-creating-an-account)

[Verify your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#3-verifying-your-email-address)

[Configure two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#4-configuring-two-factor-authentication)

[Learning Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#1-learning-git) - add directions here for just this project

[Setting up git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#2-setting-up-git) - for newbies not interested in terminal/etc, github desktop is fine, will need ssh

[Choosing how to interact with Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#3-choosing-how-to-interact-with-github) - this section is helpful as it explains how to engage with the browser, etc 

[Writing on github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#4-writing-on-github) - markdown is your friend this project is entirely in markdown

## How do I use this repository?

Once you have the above set up and reviewed, it's time to contribute!

Part of these directions is divided into two paths: Command-line Git and Github Desktop. The first is for folks who want to use the command line tool that comes with their computer (assuming either Windows or Mac). The second is for those who are using Github Desktop. There is no difference between the two other than your comfort level with one or the other.

After you get set up with the github tools, we'll cover options for writing or editing files from this repository. There are a lot more options for this, so I'll only be covering a few. Feel free to find what works best for you.
