# About This Project

Cryptids have long haunted our imaginations and folklore. Bigfoot, the chupacabra, Nessie, the Jersey Devil, vampires, the fae, kraken, the mothman, werewolves, and more all feature in the stories we tell ourselves to inspire wonder and mystery. By living on the borders of society, at the edges of the map marked "here be dragons", cryptids exist in the liminal spaces between fact and fiction.

These myths and mythologies don't conform to society's expectations for how someone should look, act, or think. They also are misunderstood, feared, or despised because of some trait innate to them that they may have no control over. These mythical creatures often are used as stand-ins for the things we truly fear in ourselves and others.

Like cryptids, the lack of information on a marginalized group or a deliberate release and perpetuation of false information shapes the view of that group. The legends we tell ourselves about ourselves and others are important. Who controls those legends determines how the people and mythical creatures the legends are based on are portrayed. If the portrayal is believable enough to the public, it can lead to disbelief, fear, or violence.

There is a long and varied history of using cryptids as metaphors for the people society fears and despises. Bram Stoker's Dracula is a perfect example of vampire as immigrant threat. Not only does the traditional vampire not assimilate into the culture (e.g. they have to sleep in the soil of their homeland, not the soil of their adoptive country), they often pose a threat to the women of that culture (a trope very often used to excuse the persecution and murder of marginalized people, especially BIPOC men).

Other cryptids, such as the Chupacabra, are believed to be inexplicable and inhuman forces of evil and destruction. Similarly, how often have racists and homophobes similarly described people of color and queer individuals? It's easy to "other" your enemies, and even easier to depict them as monsters to your credulous followers. But what if we only fear cryptids because we don't understand them?

As a marginalized person, it's often easier to identify with monster than monster hunter in stories about liminal creatures being pursued by the agents of conformity. And sometimes it's easy to sympathize with just wanting to allowed to live in peace. This project seeks to not only tell stories of cryptids, but also to defy the narrative that the other, different, and strange are bad.

We can use this metaphor, to bring our experiences out of the darkness and into the light where we can show that maybe there isn't anything to be scared of in the first place.

Sometimes these stories can reveal new perspectives on the world we hadn't had before. Perhaps the Chupacabra only feeds on sick goats, helping to save the herd from the spread of disease.

Sometimes when we see how others live, we realize their experience is closer to our own than we'd thought. Maybe the Mothman works at a lamp store in an old part of town and their words of doom are meant to protect the neighborhood they love from gentrification.

And sometimes we can tell stories of identity that are stories of resistance. What if the Kraken only sunk ships to protect her home from overfishing and pollution?

This project invites you to consider what would happen if cryptids existed and lived among us. Would they be our neighbors, or would their children be barred from our schools? Would they be harassed by police just because of what they were and what they looked like? Would their children be taken from them to be raised by "approved parents" to uphold other people's values? Would they be allowed to fight for the country, but not allowed to vote? Would their marriage not be recognized by the government? Could they "pass" as human, but still be liable to being fired if anyone found out? Would they be hunted for being different or even murdered for not being human? How would they survive and thrive in a world that doesn't believe in them and fears those who are different?

Using this metaphor, we can explore what are serious and deadly societal problems through the lense of belonging and what it means to be different. Inspire yourself and others to look at the world differently and perhaps understand others a little better.

Even though the theme may be serious, these aren't stories of despair. The characters live on the margins of society, but their experiences are not hopeless. Even as cryptids, they have strength, perseverance, and hope.

By telling our stories through the lens and experiences of fictional cryptids, we change the narrative. Instead of depicting them as insensate murder machines or dangerous mysteries, we can share stories of how we are affected when we are marginalized. These are stories of people and mythical creatures finding their place in a world that doesn't believe in them and triumphing over those who would hunt or harm them.

We are the cryptids, and these are our stories.
